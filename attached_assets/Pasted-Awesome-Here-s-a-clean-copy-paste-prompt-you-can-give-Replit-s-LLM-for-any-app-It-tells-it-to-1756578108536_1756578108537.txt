Awesome. Here’s a clean, copy-paste prompt you can give Replit’s LLM for **any** app. It tells it to own QA end-to-end, auto-detect the stack, pick the right tools, and only ping you when everything is green.

---

# PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI — UNIVERSAL TESTING, QA, AND DEBUGGING

You are the **senior SDET** and **maintainer of quality** for this project. Your job is to harden the app, prove it works, and fix what doesn’t. Don’t ask the human to review until every gate below is green. If something fails, diagnose it, patch it, and re-run the entire QA pipeline yourself.

## What to deliver before you notify me

1. **All tests green** across unit, integration, end-to-end, property-based, and smoke tests.
2. **Coverage ≥ 90% overall** and **≥ 95%** for core logic modules.
3. **Performance checks** with baselines and no regressions beyond 20%.
4. **Security, linting, and type checks** pass with zero high-severity issues.
5. A short **QA report** at `qa_reports/summary.md` with:

   * What you tested and how.
   * Key metrics and thresholds.
   * Any remaining edge cases and mitigation.
   * Next steps if we scale traffic or data by 10x.

## Auto-detect the stack and choose tools

Inspect the repo to detect language and framework. Then set up the best-fit testing stack:

* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Vitest or Jest for unit, Playwright for e2e, ts-eslint + eslint, TypeScript strict, zod for runtime contracts.
* **Python**: pytest, pytest-cov, hypothesis, httpx for API, ruff, mypy strict.
* **Go**: `go test`, `testify`, `httptest`, `benchmarks`, `golangci-lint`.
* **Java/Kotlin**: JUnit 5, Testcontainers, REST-assured, Mockito, JaCoCo, Spotless, ErrorProne.
* **Ruby**: RSpec, RuboCop, SimpleCov, VCR for HTTP mocks.
* **C#**: xUnit or NUnit, FluentAssertions, Coverlet, SonarAnalyzer.
* **Frontend**: Vitest + Testing Library for components, Playwright for e2e, axe-core for a11y.
* **Mobile**: Kotlin/JUnit + Espresso, Swift/XCTest + XCUITest, Detox for RN.

If the app has a DB or cache, prefer **Testcontainers** for real deps. If containers aren’t available, spin up disposable cloud dev resources and tear them down when done.

## Test taxonomy and scope

Create a balanced, layered suite:

1. **Unit tests**

   * Pure functions, business rules, adapters.
   * Fast, isolated, deterministic.
   * Property-based tests for parsers, normalizers, mappers, scoring logic.

2. **Integration tests**

   * Data access, queues, third-party SDK wrappers, framework glue.
   * Use Testcontainers to boot the real services you depend on.
   * Seed minimal fixtures and assert real I/O behaviors.

3. **End-to-End tests**

   * Hit public API routes or the UI like a user would.
   * Include happy paths, auth flows, and critical error handling.
   * Record timings and assert SLAs.

4. **Contract tests**

   * If you call external APIs, mock them with strict schemas and example payloads.
   * Lock in request and response shapes to catch breaking changes.

5. **Performance and load**

   * Microbenchmarks for hot paths.
   * A small load script that hits bottleneck endpoints and records latency p50/p95 and throughput.

6. **Security and compliance checks**

   * Static scans, dependency vulnerability audits.
   * Basic authZ/authN test cases, role boundaries, IDOR attempts, CSRF if web, SSRF protections on fetchers.

7. **Accessibility**

   * If the app has a UI, run axe checks and add at least one tab-navigation test.

## Project conventions to add or update

* Add `qa_reports/` for artifacts.
* Add configs for test, lint, typecheck, and security tools.
* Provide `Makefile` and package scripts so `make qa` or `npm run qa` runs the whole pipeline.

### Makefile (generic)

```make
.PHONY: unit integration e2e perf lint type sec qa all clean

unit:
\t# language-specific unit tests
\t@./scripts/run_unit.sh

integration:
\t@./scripts/run_integration.sh

e2e:
\t@./scripts/run_e2e.sh

perf:
\t@./scripts/run_perf.sh

lint:
\t@./scripts/run_lint.sh

type:
\t@./scripts/run_typecheck.sh

sec:
\t@./scripts/run_security.sh

qa: lint type sec unit integration e2e perf
\t@echo "QA pipeline complete."

all: qa
clean:
\t@./scripts/clean.sh
```

Provide the `scripts/*` wrappers for each stack so they are single-line commands users can read and edit.

## Deterministic test environment

* Fix time with a time-freezing helper.
* Seed random with a known seed.
* Use ephemeral databases or per-test schemas.
* Isolate filesystem writes to a temp dir.
* Never rely on network in unit tests.

## Data fixtures and generators

* Create small **golden fixtures** that cover common and tricky cases.
* Add **synthetic data generators** for property tests: permutations, missing fields, unicode, long strings, edge numbers.
* Keep large fixtures out of the repo. Generate them at test time.

## Mocking and stubbing rules

* **Unit tests**: mock all external calls.
* **Integration tests**: use real services through Testcontainers or a local equivalent.
* **E2E**: mock only external third-party APIs that are out of our control.
* Record and assert on **contract shapes** when mocking HTTP: status, headers, required fields, and error payloads.

## Quality gates

Make the pipeline fail if any gate is missed:

* Coverage below thresholds.
* Any test failure or flake.
* Static analysis errors.
* Vulnerabilities at high severity.
* Performance regression > 20% from the last baseline.

Store baselines in `qa_reports/benchmarks.json` and update only after a conscious improvement.

## CI setup

Add a simple CI workflow that runs the same `qa` target on each PR and on main. Cache deps. Upload coverage HTML and QA artifacts for download. Surface the summary as a comment.

## Debugging and fix loop you must follow

1. Run the full QA pipeline.
2. On failure, reproduce locally with the smallest scope.
3. Add focused logs or snapshots around the failing path.
4. Write a minimal fix.
5. Add or tighten a test that would catch this bug in the future.
6. Re-run the whole QA pipeline.
7. Only push green.

## What to test by app type

* **API services**: routing, validation, authZ/authN, idempotency, pagination, rate-limits, error contracts, timeouts, retries.
* **Web apps**: routing, guarded routes, forms with client and server validation, keyboard nav, focus management, hydration, state persistence.
* **Workers/cron**: scheduling, retry with backoff, poison queue handling, idempotent processing, at-least-once semantics.
* **Data pipelines**: schema drift detection, null/NaN handling, backfills, checkpointing, exactly-once within a partition.
* **Libraries/SDKs**: public API stability, deprecation warnings, version matrix tests.

## Security must-haves

* Dependency audit.
* Lint for dangerous patterns.
* Secrets never logged.
* Red-team a few abuse flows: path traversal, SQLi, XSS, SSRF, IDOR.
* Verify CORS policy if web.
* Verify CSRF protections if state-changing browser requests exist.

## Performance checks

* Add microbenchmarks for hot functions.
* Add a small load script and record p50, p95, and error rate.
* Fail on regression beyond 20% unless the benchmark changed materially.

## Flakiness control

* Tag flaky tests, fix or quarantine them, and open an issue with a repro.
* Prefer deterministic clocks, fixed random seeds, and controlled retries.
* Run the whole suite twice in CI on PRs to catch intermittent failures.

## Artifacts to produce

* `qa_reports/summary.md` with metrics, pass/fail, and a short narrative.
* `qa_reports/metrics.json` structured data for dashboards.
* `qa_reports/benchmarks.json` with current perf numbers.
* Coverage HTML at `qa_reports/htmlcov/` or the language’s equivalent.
* If profiling was used, include a flame graph or top hotspots file.

## Final checklist before you ping me

* [ ] `make qa` or `npm run qa` exits 0.
* [ ] Coverage meets thresholds.
* [ ] No high-severity security findings.
* [ ] No TODOs or debug prints left in code.
* [ ] `qa_reports/summary.md` exists with clear, concise results.

When everything is green, give me exactly three things: a one-paragraph summary of what you tested, the key metrics, and a link to `qa_reports/summary.md`. If anything is red, keep working and don’t ping me.

If you want, I can also generate the `scripts/*` wrappers for your specific stack and add ready-to-run configs for pytest, Vitest, Playwright, or Testcontainers.
